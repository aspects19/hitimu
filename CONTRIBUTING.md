# Contributing to Hitimu


 All contributions are **welcome**. <br>
 Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving the documentation,
Designs contributions are also welcome.<br>

## üöÄ Workflow Conventions

- Use feature branches (`feat/login-page`, `fix/navbar-glitch`) for development.
- Always create a Pull Request (PR) into the `main` branch.
- Keep PRs focused and under 300 lines if possible.
- Reference related issues in PRs (e.g., `Closes #42`).
- PRs require at least one approval before merging.
- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run prettier` and `npm run test` before pushing.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):  
  Example: `feat(auth): add Google login support`

---

## üß± Code Style & Constraints

- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) ‚Äî config is already included.
- Indentation: 2 spaces
- Prefer `const` over `let` unless reassignment is necessary.
- Avoid using `any` in TypeScript ‚Äî be explicit with types.
- Keep components/functions under ~100 lines. Break them down if too long.
- No inline styles. Use CSS modules or Tailwind CSS (as configured).
- All code must pass TypeScript checks (`tsc`).

---

## üß™ Testing

- All new features must include tests (unit or integration).
- Use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit tests.
- Run `npm test` locally before pushing.

## üìù Documentation

- Update the README if you add or change functionality.
