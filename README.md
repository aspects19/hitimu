# Hitimu | A hackathon project
https://hitimu.vercel.com
### Introduction
Access to study material by students is a major barrier faced by students. Platforms that offer this service eg **Studocu** often have paywalls and strict upload policies preventing easy access to study material.
**Hitimu** is a platform for students that simplifies sharing of study material. Students can upload, view, download, and comment on documents like notes, past papers, essays, and much more.
